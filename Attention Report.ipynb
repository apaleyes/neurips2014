    "This notebook contains scripts for emailing area chairs notifying them of potential problems with the papers allocated to them. The script goes through the calibrated reviews (as generated by [this notebook](./Reviewer Calibration.ipynb)) and seeks papers which seem problematic in terms of either the span of the review scores, the confidence of the reviewers, the length of the reviews or those that are in the 'grey area' for publication. For each paper it creates a set of comments, which is then emailed out to area chairs."

    "This report was used for NIPS before author feedback to ensure that the Area Chairs had a good overview of where their papers were, both in terms of their own reviews, and relative to other papers in the system. It is not always easy as an area chair to know where the decision boundary is going to fall. Calibrated review scores help in assessing this. It could have also been used more in the reviewer discussion stage, but we decided that it was more convenient to share information via google spreadsheets. That also allowed Area Chairs to store notes and feedback information to us. As well as organising and highlighting their papers in the manner which they thought most appropriate. Those sheets were created by [this notebook](./Spreadsheet Reports.ipynb) and then updated every day as the reviews evolved by [this notebook](./Update Spreadsheets.ipynb)."
