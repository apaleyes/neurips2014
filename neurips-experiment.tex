\begin{abstract}
    The NeurIPS experiment showed that the conference reviewing process is inconsistent. The experiment showed that in an independent rerunning of the conference half of the presented papers in the program would be different. 
    
    This paper reviews the NeurIPS experiment and explores what has happened to the body of papers submitted to the 2014 NeurIPS conference in the seven years that have elapsed.

    Paper decisions showed an inconsistency of TK\% between the two committees, but now we are able to see if the decisions of these committees resulted in impactful papers.
