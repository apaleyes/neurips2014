\section{Introduction}

This paper revists the 2014 NeurIPS experiment. The 2014 NeurIPS Experiment demonstrated that the conference reviewing process can be inconsistent. It showed that if the conference was independently rerun, half the presented papers would be different. 

In this paper we revisit the NeurIPS 2014 experiemnt
