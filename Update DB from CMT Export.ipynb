    "Reviewers can update their email address in CMT at any time. This is inconvenient because it's being used as the primary key to match reviewers to the local data base. This script tries to handle updates made in CMT and synchronize them across the local data base. It would be a lot easier to do this if we had access to the unique reviewer key stored in CMT (then we could use that as a primary key) but we don't seem to have access to that. In fact it was only very late on that I thought about it, and I haven't asked CMT if we can 'see' it."
